## Introduction
As an avid music listener, after the discovery of the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and an accompanying [python library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/#), I was very excited to get in and start playing with some of my own user data!

In my Spotify library, I have a master playlist of songs that fit into my favorite mash-up of genres -- Post-harcore, pop punk, metalcore, and alt-rock.
