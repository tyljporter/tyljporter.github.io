# Introduction
As an avid music listener, after the discovery of the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and an accompanying [python library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/#), I was very excited to dig in and start playing with some of my own user data! As any analyst knows, getting access to clean, usable data is often 80% of the work.

In my Spotify library, I have a master playlist of songs that fit into my favorite mash-up of genres: Post-harcore, pop punk, metalcore, and alt-rock; when I come across new music that fits into the genre, I throw it into that playlist so that I can come back to it later.

Spotify makes it easy to 'like' certain songs and places them in a separate, private playlist.
This got me thinking; assuming that all of my 'liked' songs are within the above playlist, can we use Machine Learning to decipher what makes a song go from simply a good song to one that I absolutely love?
