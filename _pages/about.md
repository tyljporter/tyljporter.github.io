### Hello visitor!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site.

I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Business Analytics remotely through the University of Iowa and am set to graduate in April.
My current remote position with LIFT has allowed me to quickly turn around after class and apply what i've been learning, and I am fortunate enough to have a genuine interest in analytics; Doing cool stuff with data never ceases to amaze not only me, but those around me!

A few of my favorite things in the world:
* Music [(Check out my last.fm!)](https://www.last.fm/user/Typo19)
* Cars
* Technology
* Cooking
* Craft Beer [(Check out how many unique craft beers i've had!)](https://untappd.com/user/typo_19/beers)

Have a look around and don't hesitate to reach out to me via any channel listed on the left. <br />
(P.S.-I love working on cool projects with likeminded analysts!!)
