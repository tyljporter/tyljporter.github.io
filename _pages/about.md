### Hello visitor!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site.

As of April 2021, I am now a graduate of the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business with my MS in Business Analytics.

Click here to see a list of classes I've completed during my education. I am currently in process moving all of my work completed to this site.

Doing cool stuff with data never ceases to amaze not only me, but those around me!

A few of my favorite things in the world:
* Music [(Check out my last.fm!)](https://www.last.fm/user/Typo19)
* Cars
* Technology
* Cooking
* Craft Beer [(Check out how many unique craft beers i've had!)](https://untappd.com/user/typo_19/beers)
* Traveling (See the photo of my wife and I hiking in Phoenix!)

Have a look around and don't hesitate to reach out to me via any channel listed on the left. <br />
(P.S.-I love working on cool projects with like-minded analysts!)
