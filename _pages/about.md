### Hello visitor!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. If you made it here, I would love for you to take a look at some of the work that I have been lucky enough to complete!

I am currently pursuing a M.S. of Business Analytics degree through the University of Iowa and am set to graduate in April.
My current position with LIFT has allowed me to quickly turn around after class and apply what i've been learning, and I am fortunate enough to have a genuine interest in analytics; Doing cool stuff with data never ceases to amaze not only me, but those around me!

Have a look around and don't hesitate to reach out to me via any channel listed on the left.
(P.S.-I love working on cool projects with likeminded analysts!!)
